# NHL Predictive Analytics
Predicts Game Outcomes of NHL regular season games.  Uses data acquired from Peter Tanner at moneypuck.com which includes data from the 2008-2009 season up until the 2018-2019 season, excluding the shortened, 48-game 2012-2013 season.

### Pred_Num_Wins.ipynb
A jupyter notebook following the process of developing an algorithm that predicts the number of regulation/overtime wins (ROW) and NHL team accrued amidst a regular season based on their average statistics over the course of the season.  The algorithm was developed to help determine which statistics are most influential in a team's success over the course of the season.

### Game_Predictions.ipynb
A jupyter notebook outlining the process of creating an algorithm to predict the outcome of NHL regular season games based strictly on each participating team's average statistics over their past 15 games.  While this only allows for prediction of the final 67 games of each team's season, it resulted in a respectable 58% accuracy.
